<h2>Comments</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>There is a way to write code elements that the JS interpreter will ignore. Such elements are called<strong> comments</strong>. Comments make code more readable and comprehensible for developers, even though the interpreter will ignore them.</p><p>JavaScript supports two types of comments: single-line and multi-line comments. Let's look at them more closely.</p><h5 id="single-line-comments">Single-line comments</h5><p><strong>Single-line comments</strong> refer to comments that only occupy one line. Take a careful look at the syntactic features of these comments:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log("Nice to see you!"); // This code outputs the message to the console</code></pre><p>In the example above, the text after <code class="language-javascript">//</code> is ignored by the interpreter. With the help of this note, you can understand what a specific code fragment is intended for, even if it's been a while since you wrote it.</p><h5 id="multi-line-comments">Multi-line comments</h5><p>Comments that take up several lines are called <strong>multi-line comments</strong>. These are their syntactic features:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">/*  
  The following code outputs the message to the console
  The console will display a line with the text "Hello, JS!"
*/
console.log("Hello, JS!");</code></pre><p>The interpreter ignores all text between <code class="language-javascript">/*</code> and the nearest <code class="language-javascript">*/</code>. Such comments help explain complex code pieces or temporarily comment out code fragments when you need to find an error. Also, multi-line comments at the beginning of a file are pretty useful for specifying copyright information.</p><p>Sometimes, you may find a slightly modified syntax of multi-line notes: the comment opens with the <code class="language-javascript">/**</code> tag, and each line starts with an <code class="language-javascript">*</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">/**
* The first program
* Author: Bob  
*/
console.log("Hi, I'm Bob");</code></pre><p>Such comments often contain information about the programming file, including its name, version, and the script author.</p><p>JavaScript does not support nested comments. This means that you cannot write a comment inside another comment.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>Comments make your code more transparent and simplify the work of programmers who will work with your code in the future, including yourself. Comments can also temporarily comment out code fragments when you need to find an error. In other words, you can benefit from comments. So don't ignore them, even though your JS interpreter will. Do not overuse comments, however; use them wisely, and do not forget that comments can't replace well-written code.</p>
